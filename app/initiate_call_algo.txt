Processes:
MS (Mobile Subscriber)
BSS (Base Station Subsystem):
    BSC (Base Station Controller)
    BTS (Base Transceiver Station)
MSC (Mobile Switching Center)
VLR (Virtual Location Register)
HLR (Home Location Register)
AuC (Authentication Center)
PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network)

Resources:
radio resource

1. Call init:
MS sends a request for radio resource allocation to the BSS
BSS assigns the MS a channel with a given frequency and time slot
The channel constitutes the communication route between the MS and the BSS

2. MS confirms the established channel
BSS can initiate the connection to the MSC

3. Authentication:
MS connects to the network
AuC verifies the subscriber using the IMSI number
MS and the MSC can start communicating

Encryption:
MSC initiates a ciphering procedure and transmits to the BTS
BTS forwards the ciphering procedure to the MS
MS enables ciphering to the BTS

4. MSC verifies that the requested service is allowed for the subscriber using the VLR
VLR confirms the service requested
MSC starts the call setup

5. MSC allocates a voice channel between the MSC and the BSS
BSS notifies the MS about the change to voice mode
MS returns a confirmation message
MSC routes the call to the dialled number
MSC is notified that the called subscriber is being alerted when the call is received
MS receives a ring notification
